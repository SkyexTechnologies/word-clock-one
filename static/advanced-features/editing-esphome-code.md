**Please note that modifying the ESPHome code installed on the clock is done at your own risk.** Making changes to the code can potentially affect the functionality and performance of the clock. It is important to exercise caution, have a good understanding of the code, and make backups before proceeding with any modifications.

If you wish to make more advanced changes to the clock, you will need to add the ESPHome code to your dashboard. Follow these steps to do so:

1. Ensure that the clock has been added to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). If you haven't done this yet, refer to the instructions for [Connecting to Home Assistant](https://skyextechnologies.github.io/word-clock-one/home-assistant.html).

2. Make sure that the ESPHome Add-on [is installed](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html) in Home Assistant.

3. If the ESPHome Add-on is correctly installed, the clock should automatically appear in the dashboard. Press the `adopt` button to proceed.

4. Once you have adopted the clock, you will be able to customize the `.yaml` code according to your preferences.

5. After making some modifications you have to save and install the firmware onto the clock.

By following these steps, you can add the ESPHome code to your Home Assistant dashboard and begin making advanced customizations to your clock.
