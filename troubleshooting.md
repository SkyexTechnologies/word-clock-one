## How to reset the clock?
Located on the back of the clock, there is a push button that provides functionality for restarting or resetting the device. To restart the clock, simply press and hold the button for 2 seconds. If you wish to perform a factory reset, press and hold the button for 10 seconds. It's important to note that a factory reset will erase all settings and restore the clock to its original state. 

As an alternative to using the physical push button on the back of the clock, you can also use the buttons `Restart Word Clock` or `Factory Reset Word Clock` on the clock's webpage.

## Time is incorrect
The clock automatically sets the time based on the time settings of your router, including the time, time zone, and any adjustments for winter or summer time. However, if you find that the time is incorrect for any reason, you can manually adjust it using the sliders in the webpage labeled "06. Hour Offset" and "07. Minutes Offset". These sliders allow you to add the correct number of hours and minutes to align the clock with the accurate time.

## Clock is turned off in a dark room
Please note that if you have set a very low value for `04. Minimum Brightness` or selected this value in a brightly lit room, the clock may appear turned off or extremely dim (in a dark room). In such situations, it is advisable to adjust the brightness setting by increasing the value for `04. Minimum Brightness`. 

## Webpage does not load
In certain situations, it might not be possible to access the webpage via `word-clock-one-xxxxxx.local` due to router settings. If you encounter this issue, you can try accessing the webpage by entering the IP address directly. To find the IP address, you can check your router's configuration or employ network scanning tools like [Fing](https://www.fing.com/) to discover the assigned IP address for your clock. If you are still unable to access the webpage or encounter any difficulties, you can attempt restarting the clock by holding the button located on the back of the device for 2 seconds.

Please note that you can find the unique ID (`xxxxxx`) written on the backside of the clock.

## Clock randomly restarts
If you do not use a power supply with the correct ratings, you may experience an unstable clock that occasionally restarts due to insufficient power. It is important to ensure that the power supply or adapter you use meets the minimum requirements. Make sure that the power supply/adaptor provides at least 1A (ampere) of current and operates at 5V (volts). This will help ensure a stable power source and prevent issues related to insufficient power supply.
